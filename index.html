  				How do we define Public Interest Technology?<br>
  				<br>
  				Technology, created through interdisciplinary design  processes, which serves the public good. This can apply to any kind of technology that advances justice, equity, and inclusion in society.<br>
				We take inspiration from the Ford Foundation's perspective on PIT. <br>
