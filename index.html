					Columbia University is excited to pilot the Public Interest Technology (PIT) Summer Lab We will introduce interdisciplinary design processes and principles for Human Computer Interaction(HIC) — mixing Architecture, Urban Planning, Computer Science, and Journalism — that respond to the potentials as well as the adverse effects of computation on society today. In this program, students will brainstorm, create and deploy interdisciplinary projects which offer a new imagination of PIT.    We are currently seeking applicants who are interested in working in a field dedicated to leveraging technology to support public interest organizations. Our work will move beyond short-term metrics—clicks, daily active users, and private profit—fostering long-term value, local networks, respecting the histories and cultures of the communities we engage through design.. Anyone, regardless of year or field or major, is eligible!
					<br><br> The three week program will be held June 6th to June 28th at Columbia for 20 hours each week.
					<br><br> Participants will be paid $1200 for their time and effort.
					<br><br>The priority application deadline is February 29th, 2020.
					<br><br>Please find the application here.

					<br><br>If you have any questions, please email Professor <a href="mailto:chilton@cs.columbia.edu">Lydia Chilton at chilton@cs.columbia.edu</a>

  				<br>
				PIT is a broad field which encapsulates many different types of technology - arts tech, civic tech, education tech, and more! Here are some key examples of PIT in the real world:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>: since 2008, thousands have used this crowdsourcing platform in disaster settings, from violence post-election to earthquakes and floods worldwide</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.stenaapp.com/">Stenaapp</a>: an application that connects artists to coffeeshops to display and sell their artwork</li>
				<li><a href="https://cuimpact.pythonanywhere.com/">CUImpact</a>: an application that connects students on Columbia's campus to activist events based on social justice issues</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.courbanize.com/">coUrbanize</a>: an application that tackles gentrification issues by connecting real estate developers and planners with neighbors</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.antievictionmap.com/">Anti Eviction Mapping</a>: is a volunteer data-visualization, data analysis, and storytelling collective documenting the dispossession and resistance upon gentrifying landscapes</li>

          <ul>
			You will collaborate with people from diverse fields, including Journalism, Architecture, Urban Planning, Design, Computer Science, Sociology,and Anthropology to research and build technology that works in the public interest. Projects will be determined by the students with ample mentorship and support. We will also establish connections to community partners with whom students might choose to  engage.
			<br>You will learn through thinking and doing.
			<br>You will meet PIT professionals and learn about PIT in industry.
			<br>You will join and build a tight-knit cohort of individuals devoted to using their respective skills to advance society and the built environment in meaningful ways.
