  			Columbia University is excited to pilot the <b>Public Interest Technology (PIT) Summer Institute</b>, a collaboration between the Computer Science, Architecture, and Journalism departments. In this program, students will brainstorm, create and deploy interdisciplinary projects that work for the public good.<br>
  			<br>
  			We are currently seeking applicants who are interested in working in a field dedicated to leveraging technology to support public interest organizations and the people they serve. Anyone, regardless of year or field or major, is eligible!<br>
  			<br>
  			The 3-week program will be held June 6th to June 28th at Columbia for 20 hours each week. Participants will be paid $1200 for their time and effort. <br>

  				<br>
  				Technology, created through interdisciplinary design  processes, which serves the public good. This can apply to any kind of technology that advances justice, equity, and inclusion in society.<br>
          <br>
				We take inspiration from the <a href="">Ford Foundation's perspective on PIT.</a> <br>
